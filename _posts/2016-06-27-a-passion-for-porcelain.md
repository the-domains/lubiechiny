  The porcelain mania that gripped Europe prior to 1700 and after 1708, when the
  Europeans cracked the most closely guarded secret in Chinese decorative arts,
  has truly subsided. Nowadays, porcelain ware is usually relegated to minor
  displays in most museum situations, and in households with heirlooms. It is
  displayed in forbidding glass cabinets in motley collections that rather
  glorify the gaudy, with pieces that hold purely sentimental value.
